            <h2>NZ Natural Forest</h2>
            <img src="./img/Natural_DouglasFir-2.jpg" alt="Natural Forest" style="width:100%;">


            <p> Natural Forest refer to any forest that exists in its natural state, relatively undisturbed by human
                activities.
                Wood from native trees helped build New Zealand. The evidence is everywhere – from fence posts and
                railway sleepers to older houses and public buildings.
                These are relics of a time when people saw native forests as a limitless resource to be used.
                Today, many want to preserve them for their beauty and ecological importance.

            <h3>Example of Natural Forest</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>Pinus radiata (Monterey Pine):While not indigenous to New Zealand, monterey pine grows naturally in
                    forests and is widely planted in plantations, particularly in areas where logging or reforestation
                    has taken place.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Eucalyptus species (Gum Trees):Numerous eucalyptus species, including Eucalyptus nitens and
                    Eucalyptus globulus, are native to New Zealand and are typically found in plantation forests, though
                    they are also occasionally found in natural forest environments.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa): This species, also called macrocarpa, is not indigenous to New
                    Zealand but has been widely planted there for the purpose of producing timber, controlling erosion,
                    and creating shelterbelts. It is occasionally found in natural forest areas, particularly in arid
                    climates.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Acacia species (Wattles): Many acacia species, such as Acacia dealbata (silver wattle) and Acacia
                    melanoxylon (blackwood), have been brought to New Zealand and are found in both natural and
                    plantation forests.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii): In New Zealand, Douglas fir is a non-native species that has
                    been widely planted for its timber. Sometimes, especially in places where it has been introduced for
                    forestry purposes, it can be found in natural forest settings.
